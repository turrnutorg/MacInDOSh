MacInDOSh (Macintosh Inside DOS) is an open source recreation of the Macintosh System Software 1.0 intended for x86 based machines. 

Currently, MacInDOSh is built on top of MS-DOS, using the Borland Turbo C (TCC) development environment and compiler. It is currently INCOMPATIBLE with modern compilers such as GCC or Clang.

Eventually, it will be moved to a more modern development environment and made into a standalone Operating System, but as of now, it is currently a DOS-only program. 

!!! WARNING !!! 

Attempting to close the program by pressing 'Q' within the app, for unknown reasons, takes down the ENTIRE computer/dos emulator, for currently unknown reasons.
