MacInDOSh (Macintosh Inside DOS) is an open source recreation of the Macintosh System Software 1.0 intended for x86 based machines. 
Currently, MacInDOSh is built on top of MS-DOS, using the Borland Turbo C (TCC) development environment and compiler. It is currently INCOMPATIBLE with modern compilers such as GCC or Clang.
Eventually, it will be moved to a more modern development environment and made into a standalone Operating System, but as of now, it is currently a DOS-only program.
