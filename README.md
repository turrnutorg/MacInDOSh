MacInDOSh (Macintosh Inside DOS) is an open source recreation of the Macintosh System Software 1.0 intended for x86 based machines. 

Currently, MacInDOSh is built on top of MS-DOS, using the Borland Turbo C (TCC) development environment and compiler. It is currently INCOMPATIBLE with modern compilers such as GCC or Clang.

We are currently working to bring MacInDOSh to its own native os, but that will take time! 

!!! WARNING !!! 

In its current state, attempting to close the program by pressing 'Q' within the app, for unknown reasons, takes down the ENTIRE computer/dos emulator, due to DOS only allowing 640k of Conventional Memory.
